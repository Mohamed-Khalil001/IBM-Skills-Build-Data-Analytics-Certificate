# Module 1: Classifying and Sourcing Data

## Module Overview

In this module, we explore the fundamentals of data and its classifications, essential for quantitative analysis. We’ll cover:

- **What is Data?**: Defining data and its role in decision-making.
- **Data Analysis vs. Data Analytics**: Distinguishing their purposes and applications.
- **Data Classifications**:
  - **By Source**: Primary vs. Secondary Data.
  - **By Nature**: Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data.
  - **By Format**: Structured vs. Unstructured Data.
- **Applications**: Using these classifications in quantitative analysis to make informed decisions.

**Classification Dimensions**:

- **Source**: Primary Data (collected directly) vs. Secondary Data (obtained from others).
- **Nature**: Quantitative Data (numerical, measurable) vs. Qualitative Data (descriptive, non-numerical).
- **Format**: Structured Data (organized, e.g., databases) vs. Unstructured Data (unorganized, e.g., text).
  These dimensions are distinct but overlapping. For example, data can be primary, quantitative, and structured, depending on its collection, content, and organization.

**Case Study**: Throughout, we’ll use a Quantitative Investment Fund, where a data analyst evaluates performance metrics (e.g., return on investment, trade volume) and investor sentiments to optimize investment strategies, assess risks, and predict returns.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is Data?

**Etymology**: From Latin _datum_ (plural: _data_), meaning “something given” or “a fact.” Data represents information collected for analysis.

**Definition**: Data is any piece of information—numerical or descriptive—that can be collected, analyzed, and interpreted to make decisions. It’s all around us, from the number of houses on a street to stats from wearable fitness devices.

**Application in Quantitative Fund Analysis**: In a Quantitative Investment Fund, data includes stock prices (e.g., $125.75), daily trade volumes (e.g., 1,200 trades), and investor feedback (e.g., “The fund is reliable”). These data points drive quantitative decisions, such as optimizing asset allocation.

**Examples Across Industries**:

- **Healthcare**: Patient vitals (e.g., heart rate) for diagnosis.
- **Automotive**: GPS data for self-driving cars.
- **Finance**: Trade volumes and ROI for investment decisions.

### 2. Data Analysis vs. Data Analytics

**Etymology**:

- _Analysis_: From Greek _analusis_, meaning “breaking down.” It involves examining data to answer specific questions.
- _Analytics_: From Greek _analutikos_, meaning “art of using data.” It encompasses proactive strategies for prediction and decision-making.

**Definitions**:

- **Data Analysis**: The process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to find useful information, reach conclusions, and support decisions. It answers specific questions about a dataset (a discrete collection of information).
- **Data Analytics**: A broader approach applying techniques to collect, analyze, and interpret data to identify trends, predict outcomes, and improve strategies proactively, often using automated algorithms.

**Application in Quantitative Fund Analysis**:

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing last year’s trade data to answer, “What was the fund’s average monthly ROI?” (e.g., 5.2%). This involves calculating metrics from a specific dataset.
- **Data Analytics**: Using historical ROI and market trends to predict next year’s fund performance, employing statistical models or machine learning to guide investment strategies.

### 3. Primary Data

**Etymology**: From Latin _primarius_, meaning “first” or “principal,” indicating data collected directly for a specific purpose.

**Definition**: Primary data is gathered by a company or its agents for its own needs, offering high accuracy but requiring significant resources.

**Application in Quantitative Fund Analysis**: To assess investor confidence, you conduct a survey asking, “How satisfied are you with the fund’s performance (1-5)?” The responses (e.g., 75% rate it 4 or higher) are primary data, providing numerical (quantitative) insights for analysis or descriptive (qualitative) comments for context.

**Pros**:

- High accuracy and relevance.
- Full control over quality.

**Cons**:

- Time-consuming and costly.

---

### 4. Secondary Data

**Etymology**: From Latin _secundarius_, meaning “second” or “derived,” referring to data collected by others.

**Definition**: Secondary data is obtained from external sources (e.g., reports, databases), making it cost-effective but potentially less specific.

**Application in Quantitative Fund Analysis**: You use a Bloomberg report to compare the fund’s ROI (e.g., 5.2%) with competitors (e.g., 4.8%). This numerical (quantitative) data, collected for market analysis, supports quantitative comparisons.

**Pros**:

- Quick and inexpensive.
- Access to large datasets.

**Cons**:

- May lack specificity or accuracy.
- Limited control over quality.

### 5. Quantitative Data

**Etymology**: From Latin _quantitas_, meaning “quantity” or “amount,” emphasizing measurable values for mathematical operations.

**Definition**: Quantitative data is numerical, enabling statistical analysis, trend identification, and predictions critical for quantitative analysis.

**Application in Quantitative Fund Analysis**: You calculate the fund’s monthly ROI (e.g., 5.2%, continuous) and daily trade volume (e.g., 1,200 trades, discrete). These metrics support calculations like risk-to-return ratios.

**Subtypes**:

- **Discrete**: Whole numbers (e.g., trade counts).
- **Continuous**: Any value in a range (e.g., stock prices).
  - **Interval**: No absolute zero (e.g., volatility index).
  - **Ratio**: Absolute zero (e.g., trade volume in dollars).

### 6. Qualitative Data

**Etymology**: From Latin _qualitas_, meaning “quality” or “character,” focusing on descriptive attributes.

**Definition**: Qualitative data is non-numerical, capturing opinions or experiences, often complementing quantitative metrics.

**Application in Quantitative Fund Analysis**: Investor comments like “The fund’s strategy is aggressive but effective” (qualitative, unstructured) provide context to ROI data, aiding strategic decisions.

**Subtypes**:

- **Nominal**: No order (e.g., asset types: Stocks, Bonds).
- **Ordinal**: Ordered (e.g., investor ratings: High, Medium, Low).

---

### 7. Structured Data

**Etymology**: From Latin _structura_, meaning “arrangement,” indicating organized formats.

**Definition**: Structured data is organized in formats like tables or databases, facilitating storage, retrieval, and quantitative analysis.

**Application in Quantitative Fund Analysis**: A SQL database of trade volumes and stock prices enables quick queries for ROI calculations.

---

### 8. Unstructured Data

**Etymology**: The prefix “un-” negates “structured,” implying a lack of predefined format.

**Definition**: Unstructured data doesn’t fit standard formats (e.g., text, social media), requiring advanced processing for quantitative insights.

**Application in Quantitative Fund Analysis**: Investor comments on X (e.g., “The fund is risky”) are unstructured but can be quantified into sentiment scores to complement ROI analysis.

## Case Study: Quantitative Fund Analysis

**Scenario**: As a data analyst for a Quantitative Investment Fund, you optimize investment strategies using performance metrics and investor sentiments.

- **Primary Data**: A survey yields quantitative ratings (e.g., 75% rate 4/5) and qualitative comments (e.g., “Reliable but risky”), both primary.
- **Secondary Data**: Bloomberg reports provide quantitative ROI (e.g., 5.2%) and qualitative market sentiment, structured in tables.
- **Quantitative Data**: ROI (continuous) and trade volume (discrete) support risk calculations.
- **Qualitative Data**: Comments (unstructured, ordinal) provide strategic context.
- **Structured Data**: Trade data in a SQL database enables quick analysis.
- **Unstructured Data**: X posts require text analysis for sentiment scores.

**Decision**: Combine primary quantitative data (ROI) with secondary qualitative data (sentiment) to recommend reducing high-risk assets, balancing cost and accuracy.
